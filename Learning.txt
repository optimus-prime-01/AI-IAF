Key differences between npm and pnpm:

Performance: pnpm is significantly faster and more efficient due to its unique disk storage structure
Disk Space: pnpm uses hard links and a content-addressable store, saving disk space by not duplicating packages across projects
Package Management:


npm creates a nested node_modules structure
pnpm creates a flat node_modules structure with symlinks


Dependency Resolution:


npm allows access to dependencies not listed in package.json
pnpm enforces strict dependency rules, preventing access to unlisted packages


Version Control: pnpm's lockfile (pnpm-lock.yaml) is more deterministic than npm's package-lock.json

Both are package managers that will work for most projects, but pnpm offers better performance and disk space usage.

Make sure that the version of tailwindcss and shadcn are same.
