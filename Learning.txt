### Key Differences Between npm and pnpm:
- **Performance**: pnpm is much faster and more efficient due to its unique disk storage mechanism.
- **Disk Space**: pnpm uses hard links and a content-addressable store, avoiding duplicate package installations across projects.
- **Package Management**:  
  - npm creates a nested `node_modules` structure.  
  - pnpm creates a flat `node_modules` structure with symlinks.  
- **Dependency Resolution**:  
  - npm allows access to dependencies not explicitly listed in `package.json`.  
  - pnpm enforces strict dependency rules, preventing access to unlisted packages.  
- **Version Control**: pnpm’s lockfile (`pnpm-lock.yaml`) is more deterministic than npm’s `package-lock.json`.  
- **General Use**: Both work for most projects, but pnpm is better in terms of performance and disk space efficiency.  

**Ensure Tailwind CSS and shadcn versions match for consistency.**

### Why Must `.env.local` Be in the Root Directory?  
Vite follows a strict order when loading environment variables and only looks for `.env` files in the root directory (same level as `vite.config.ts`). Placing `.env.local` inside a subfolder (e.g., `src/`) will prevent Vite from finding it.

### Protected Routes in React  
Protected (or private) routes restrict access to certain pages based on authentication.  

#### **How It Works:**  
1. **Check Authentication** – Verify if the user is logged in before rendering the page.  
2. **Redirect If Not Authenticated** – If not logged in, redirect the user to the login page.  
3. **Render If Authenticated** – If logged in, grant access to the page.

### `cn` Function in Tailwind CSS  
The `cn` helper function simplifies managing and combining multiple class names into a single string, making it easier to apply dynamic Tailwind CSS styles.

### TypeScript Interfaces  
In TypeScript, an interface defines the expected structure of data that a component receives as props.

### Firebase Configuration  
Firebase configuration consists of the setup details needed to initialize and connect an application to Firebase services like authentication, Firestore database, storage, and messaging.

### `AuthHandler` Component  
The `AuthHandler` component manages user authentication and stores user data in Firestore upon sign-in. It integrates Firebase Firestore, Clerk Authentication, and React Router.  

#### **Key Features:**  
- **Checks Authentication Status**  
  - Uses `useAuth()` from Clerk to verify if the user is signed in (`isSignedIn`).  
  - Uses `useUser()` to get the current user’s details.  
- **Stores User Data in Firestore** (`storeUserData` function)  
  - If the user is authenticated and doesn’t exist in Firestore, their information is saved.  
- **Handles Routing with React Router**  
  - Uses `useLocation` to get the current path (`pathname`).  
  - Uses `useNavigate` for navigation.  
  - Ensures updates run when `pathname` changes.  
- **Manages Loading State**  
  - Uses `useState` to display a `LoaderPage` while storing user data.

### Focus on Routing: Issue in Rendering `dashboard.tsx`  

#### **React Router Hooks:**  
- **`useParams`** – Extracts URL parameters from the current route.  
- **Firestore Queries:**  
  - `const interviewRef = doc(db, "interviews", interviewID);` → Retrieves a document reference for `interviewID` from the `interviews` collection.  
  - `const interviewSnap = await getDoc(interviewRef);` → Fetches the data from the referenced document.  
  - **Real-time Updates**:  
    - `onSnapshot` listens to Firestore collections for real-time changes (additions, deletions, modifications) and automatically updates the component without requiring a manual refresh.

The Container component ensures a consistent, centered layout with flexible customization, making it easier to build a responsive and maintainable UI structure.

The Outlet component is used in React Router to render child routes inside a parent route. In this case, any child routes of the /generate path will be rendered where the <Outlet /> is placed.
If there's a route like /generate/subroute, the component corresponding to subroute will be rendered in place of the <Outlet />.
